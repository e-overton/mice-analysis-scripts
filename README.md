# mice-analysis-scripts
Analysis scripts to be used with the MICE experiments reconstructed data.

Present model is to produce a set of simple scripts which produce
reasonable output for studying the performance of the MICE Tracker Detector.

To support this effort a number of "Tools" have been created which aid in
analysing the data. These tools are grouped by the support they add.

All these scripts require a sourced "MAUS" enviroment.

SciFiEfficiency: A script to understand the efficiency of the detector,
to use edit the parameters at the top of the file.
